description: Meta-rule — how to create/extend rules in this project
globs:
  - .cursor/rules/**/*.mdc
alwaysApply: false

When I ask to create a new rule:
1) Keep it **under 200 lines**, scoped to one topic.
2) Provide frontmatter with `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`.
3) Reference example files with `@path` hints where helpful.
4) Prefer checklists and concrete code blocks over prose.
5) Use my Python and desktop principles from other rules.
