- Use `mod = "mod4"`. Keep bindings **homogeneous** across layouts.
- Prefer `Key` and `KeyChord` over ad-hoc scripts. Place **all** bindings in `keys.py`.
- Launchers: `mod+SPACE` → `rofi -show drun`; `mod+b` → browser; `mod+Return` → `kitty`; `mod+e` → files; `mod+n` → `neovim` in `kitty`.
- Window mgmt: hjkl for focus **and** arrows as fallback. Provide move/resize chords under `mod+g` (go) and `mod+r` (resize).
- Audio/brightness/media: use `first_available(["wpctl", "pactl"])`, `brightnessctl`, `playerctl` wrappers.
- Use media keys on keyboard for media control - i run qmk btw.
- Provide `mod+Ctrl+r` → reload config; `mod+Shift+q` → close window; `mod+Shift+e` → power menu (rofi/eww).
- Document every binding as a tuple `(keys, action, note)` at declaration time.
- Add a keybinding help screen that reads all keybdindings and lists them - can be wrapepd into a beautiful eww widget.
